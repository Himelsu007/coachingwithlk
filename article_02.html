            <h2 class="source_serif_h1"> 1. POWERFUL QUESTIONS </h2>
            <p class="source_serif_bold">
                The transformative power of life coaching is in the right questions. The
                main idea of a life coach's work is to help the client ask the right questions so that
                they can find the answers on their own.
                So, the coach does not give ready-made solutions but stimulates you to think and
                find your own ways of solving problems. 
                They use various techniques such as open-ended questions, reframing, active listening and others to help you gain
                clarity of your thoughts and actions.
            </p>

            <h2 class="source_serif_h1">
                2. GOAL SETTING
            </h2>

            <p class="source_serif_normal">                         
                In order to achieve your goals, first, you
                need to set them correctly, including
                their correct formulation, timeframe
                determination, goal significance,
                feasibility, and your own capabilities to
                achieve them. Therefore, goal setting is
                a fundamental tool of life coaching
                making clarify precisely what clients
                want.
            </p>

            <h1 class="source_serif_h1">  3. VISUALIZATION </h1>
    
            <p class="source_serif_normal">
                Our mind has incredible power, and
                visualizing success is a great way to get
                you to achieve your desired goal. For
                example, if you are worried about your
                work and you have to give a
                presentation, you can visualize how you
                will feel before, during and after the
                presentation, receiving positive
                feedback from the audience. Gradually
                set your mind up for success until you
                actually have to face the situation.
            </p>

            <h1 class="source_serif_h1">  4 . ACCOUNTABILITY </h1>

            <p class="source_serif_normal"> 
                Through regular check-ins and setting
                achievable milestones, a life coach helps
                you stay true to your commitments. They
                provide that gentle yet firm push when
                procrastination lurks around the corner.
                It's not about placing blame or pressure;
                it's about fostering a sense of
                responsibility and ownership over your
                goals.
            </p>

            <p class="source_serif_bold"> 
                While these are core methodologies and
                techniques used by many life coaches,
                let's take a peek at some unique
                methods employed by specialized
                coaches:
            </p>

            <h1 class="source_serif_h1">  1. NEURO-LINGUISTIC PROGRAMMING (NLP) </h1>

            <p class="source_serif_normal"> 
                Ever wished you could hack into your
                own mind and rewire your thoughts for
                the better? NLP is like a user manual for
                your brain, using language and behavior
                to create new patterns. A life coach
                might employ NLP techniques, helping
                you break free from negative loops and
                sculpt a mindset that breeds success.
            </p>

                <h1 class="source_serif_h1"> 2. POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY </h1>


            <p class="source_serif_normal">
                Life's not just about fixing what's wrong;
                it's about amplifying what's right.
                Positive psychology is like putting on a
                pair of glasses that only see the good
                stuff. A life coach might sprinkle in
                positivity techniques, focusing on
                strengths, gratitude, and fostering a
                mindset that thrives on the sunny side of
                life.
            </p>

            <h1 class="source_serif_h1"> 3. MINDFULNESS AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES </h1>

            <p class="source_serif_normal"> 
                Mindfulness is like that garden for your
                mind. It's about being present in the
                moment, tuning into your thoughts and
                emotions without judgment. A life coach
                might introduce you to mindfulness
                exercises. It's not just about calming the
                storm within but also about enhancing
                your focus and clarity. These techniques
                teach you to slow down, take a deep
                breath, and regain control when life
                seems to be racing ahead.
            </p>

            <h1 class="source_serif_h1"> 4. EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE </h1>

            <p class="source_serif_normal"> 
                You've heard of IQ, but what about EQ? Emotional intelligence is like the secret sauce 
                for navigating life's emotional rollercoaster. A specialized coach might
                delve into EQ. It's about understanding your own emotions and those of others.
                With emotional intelligence, you become better equipped to manage conflicts,
                build stronger relationships, and handle life's curveballs with grace.
